# Battleship
Battleship (also called Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. It started off as a pencil and paper game, until Milton Bradley coined the rules and published the game. It was one of the first games to be produced as a computer game in 1979! In this project, I have recreated this timeless classic.

Battleship is a console-based game written in Java. Basically, two players place their ships in fogged fields. The players are required to fire and sink the opponent's ships. The player who destroys the opponent's field early, wins the game!
