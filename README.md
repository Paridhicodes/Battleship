# Battleship
Battleship (also called Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. It started off as a pencil and paper game, until Milton Bradley coined the rules and published the game. Fun fact: it was one of the first games to be produced as a computer game in 1979! In this project, we will recreate this timeless classic.
